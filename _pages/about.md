Hi! I am a junior at Davidson College, pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics and Computer Science. 

My interests lie in combinatorics, optimization, and stochastic modeling. I was a participant in the [REU program](https://cws.auburn.edu/apspi/pm/mathreu) in Abstract and Discrete Mathematics at Auburn University, where I received an intensive introduction to combinatorics and graph theory. I also worked as a research assistant to Prof. [Yan Zhuang](https://yanzhuang.name/), focusing on algebraic and combinatorial methods in permutation enumeration. I co-authored a paper on desarrangements, permutations whose first ascent is even, which are particularly interesting as they are in bijection with derangements (see [Désarménien](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220076015_Descent_Classes_of_Permutations_with_a_Given_Number_of_Fixed_Points)). During Fall 2024, I am doing an independent study in Stochastic Processes with Prof. Laurie Heyer.
