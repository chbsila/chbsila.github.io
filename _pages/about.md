Hi! I am a junior at Davidson College, pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics and Computer Science. 

My interests lie in combinatorics, optimization, and stochastic modeling. I was a participant in the REU program in Abstract and Discrete Mathematics at Auburn University, where I received an intensive introduction to combinatorics and graph theory. I also worked as a research assistant to Prof. Yan Zhuang, focusing on algebraic and combinatorial methods in permutation enumeration. I co-authored a paper on desarrangements, permutations whose first ascent is even, which are particularly interesting as they are in bijection with derangements (see Désarménien). I also independently proved a colored analogue of Ira Gessel's run theorem using noncommutative symmetric functions. During Fall 2024, I am doing an independent study in Stochastic Processes with Prof. Laurie Heyer, which I hope will evolve into a summer research program and/or an honors thesis.
